### Creating NFTs with IPFS and Dynamic NFTs with SVG

This project is created according to FreeCodeCamp Solidity Course by Patrick Collins. It helps helps to learn how to create NFTs using IPFS. It also teaches how to create dynamic NFTs with SVG. During this project we get random numbers using [ChainLink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction) and get real world data with [ChainLink PriceFeed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds).
